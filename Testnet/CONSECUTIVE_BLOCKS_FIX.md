# Consecutive Blocks Fix

## Problem Identified

**Issue**: Node was creating consecutive blocks with very small delays (~30ms), causing:
```
INFO [09-22|13:47:14.813] Successfully sealed new block number=2450 elapsed=13.207s
INFO [09-22|13:47:14.844] Successfully sealed new block number=2451 elapsed=30.026ms  ← Problem!
INFO [09-22|13:47:27.337] Successfully sealed new block number=2452 elapsed=12.491s
INFO [09-22|13:47:27.361] Successfully sealed new block number=2453 elapsed=24.062ms  ← Problem!
```

## Root Cause

The dynamic block time adjustment could result in:
1. **Zero or negative delays** when calculation goes wrong
2. **Very small delays** (< 1 second) allowing consecutive blocks
3. **No minimum delay enforcement** in the original logic

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Added Minimum Delay Protection**

```go
// In dynamic block time adjustment
minDelay := 2 * time.Second // Minimum 2 seconds between blocks
if adjustedDelay < minDelay {
    adjustedDelay = minDelay
}
```

### 2. **Added Absolute Minimum Delay**

```go
// Ensure absolute minimum delay to prevent consecutive blocks
absoluteMinDelay := 1 * time.Second
if delay < absoluteMinDelay {
    delay = absoluteMinDelay
    log.Debug("Applied absolute minimum delay", "delay", delay)
}
```

### 3. **Enhanced Delay Bounds**

**Before (Problematic):**
```go
// Could result in 0 or negative delay
if adjustedDelay < 0 {
    adjustedDelay = 0  // Problem: allows immediate blocks!
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```go
// Ensures minimum gap between blocks
minDelay := 2 * time.Second
if adjustedDelay < minDelay {
    adjustedDelay = minDelay
}

// Absolute safety net
absoluteMinDelay := 1 * time.Second
if delay < absoluteMinDelay {
    delay = absoluteMinDelay
}
```

## Test Results

### Minimum Delay Protection Tests:
```
✓ Zero delay → 1s (prevents immediate consecutive blocks)
✓ Negative delay → 1s (handles negative delays gracefully)  
✓ Small delay (500ms) → 1s (ensures minimum gap)
✓ Normal delay (5s) → 5s (preserves adequate delays)
```

### Dynamic Block Time Tests:
```
✓ High tx volume: original=100ms, adjusted=2s (minimum enforced)
✓ Dynamic block time: 15s → 7.5s (with proper minimum delay)
```

## Benefits

1. **✅ Prevents Consecutive Blocks**: Minimum 1-2 second gap between blocks
2. **✅ Maintains Network Stability**: No rapid block creation bursts
3. **✅ Preserves Dynamic Benefits**: Fast blocks still possible, but controlled
4. **✅ Safety Guarantees**: Multiple layers of minimum delay protection

## Configuration

### Delay Hierarchy:
1. **Dynamic Block Time Minimum**: 2 seconds (when dynamic adjustment is active)
2. **Absolute Minimum**: 1 second (always enforced)
3. **Wiggle Time**: Additional randomization for out-of-turn blocks

### Expected Block Intervals:
- **High Transaction Volume**: 5-7 seconds (down from 15s, but >= 2s minimum)
- **Normal Volume**: 12-15 seconds  
- **Low Volume**: 15-20 seconds
- **No Transactions**: 15 seconds (base time)

## Monitoring

Enhanced debug logging now shows:
```go
log.Debug("Dynamic block time applied",
    "base_block_time", baseBlockTime,
    "dynamic_block_time", dynamicBlockTime,
    "original_delay", originalDelay,
    "adjusted_delay", delay,
    "tx_count", txCount)

log.Debug("Applied absolute minimum delay", "delay", delay)
```

## Verification

To verify the fix is working, check logs for:
- **No consecutive blocks** with < 1 second intervals
- **Proper delay enforcement** in debug logs
- **Stable block production** without rapid bursts

## Status: ✅ FIXED

The consecutive block issue has been resolved with multiple layers of protection:
- Dynamic adjustment minimum delay: **2 seconds**
- Absolute minimum delay: **1 second**  
- Proper bounds checking and logging

**Result**: No more consecutive blocks with tiny delays!
